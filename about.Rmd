## Academic Projects
**Markov Chain in Predicting the Fluctuation of the Stock Market (Python)** [December 2019]{style="float:right"}

* Implemented Markov Chain with Python to predict fluctuations and the frequencies of state changes of the S&P500 index.
* Implemented user customization that made the user choose the numbers of desired states and time intervals of the training set to construct different transition probability matrixes and the steady-state distributions of this Markov Chain.

**Digital Image Recognition (MATLAB)** [October 2019]{style="float:right"}

* Constructed a training set of 60,000 handwritten digits into a matrix with each row containing the mean pixel values of a digit.
* Achieved the digit recognition correctness to 90% by comparing its pixels to those in each row of the training set and determine which row most closely resembles the test digits.

**This Website (Rmarkdown)** [Nov 2020]{style="float:right"}

* What you are viewing right now. 
* Created my introductory website using yaml, rmarkdown and github.io
